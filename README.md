Web app for playing the Star Trek Collectible Card Game
([ST:CCG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_Customizable_Card_Game))
with an opponent using another web browser.

Available publicly at
[net-stccg.firebaseapp.com](https://net-stccg.firebaseapp.com/).  Sign
in requires a Google account.


## To Play

1. Go to the game's home [net-stccg.firebaseapp.com](https://net-stccg.firebaseapp.com/)
2. Click the "Sign in with Google" button
3. Create (at least) a deck
    * details to go here
4. Click "Start Game"
5. Click "Get Game Code"
6. Contact the person you want to play against
    * have them go through the steps through #4
    * have them enter the Game Code you generated and
      click "Play Game"
    * when they're done, your browser will go to the play screen


## Development

### Client

The in-browser code is implemented as a single-page web application
using React and webpack.  To run it locally, open a terminal and go to
the directory containing `net-stccg`, then:

```bash
cd Webclient
npm install
npm start
```

This should open you system's default browser and connect it to the
local webpack development server.


### Server


#### Deploy

```bash
cd Webclient
npm install
npm build
cd ../Firebase
firebase login
firebase deploy
```

## To Do

### Immediate

* prevent drop of wrong type of card into list


### Features Soon

* wrap Deck in vertical scroll area
* put expandos on SubDeck headers
* can't drag from Available based on count already in deck
* filter Available Card list (card: type, affilliation)
* preload deck


### Long Term

Stuff that I skipped doing "when I could have" in order to get to a
broader set of functionality:

* tune service worker config so it handles background image, card images
* show "waiting...." spinner while Game Code is being generated
* put Google avatar image next to all uses of displayName
* refactor to put Profile component directly under App
* refactor to create a Home component that App routes to "/" and
  renders sub-components
* implement "delete" for decks
* fix console warning about how firebase lib is imported
* clean up old/orphan Game Code values
* flatten and/or extract some of the promises for db access (to make
  more readable/maintainable)
* handle window resizing

Stuff that I'd do if this were going to be a long-lived,
production-worthy project:

* establish multiple db instances/environments (dev, ci integration
  test, staging, production)
* incorporate unit & Se test frameworks, backfill missing tests
* better linting, conform to linting, automate linting
* establish CI & coverage & put badges in README
