Web app for playing the Star Trek Collectible Card Game
([ST:CCG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_Customizable_Card_Game))
with an opponent using another web browser.

## Development

### Client

The in-browser code is implemented as a single-page web application
using React and webpack.  To run it locally, open a terminal and go to
the directory containing `net-stccg`, then:

```bash
cd Webclient
npm install
npm start
```

This should open you system's default browser and connect it to the
local webpack development server.


### Server


#### Deploy

```bash
cd Webclient
npm install
npm build
cd ../Firebase
firebase login
firebase deploy
```
